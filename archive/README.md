# Archive — Rare Pepe graphic assets

Place Rare Pepe images here for the static site. The main app uses symlinks to large external dirs (~1GB); for GitHub we can host a **curated subset**.

- **`pepes/`** — Suggested: one image per asset (e.g. `PEPECASH.png`, `RAREPEPE.gif`). Naming by asset name lets the app resolve images without a DB.
- **Source**: Original site assets (see `RarePepeWorld.com/Readme.md` — MEGA links), or [Rare Pepe Directory](http://rarepepedirectory.com/). Respect rights and attribution.
- **Repo size**: Prefer a smaller set if needed; document how to add more.

The project root also has `../archive/RPD/` (Rare Pepe Directory–related favicon and sample HTML); you can copy or reference those here if useful.
