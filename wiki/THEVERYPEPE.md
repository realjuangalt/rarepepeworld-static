## Lore

The image on the card is a man dressed up as the character [Gachapin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gachapin) from the Japanese television program [Hirake! Ponkikki](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt15227182/), and its succeeding series, [Ponkickies](https://en.moegirl.org.cn/Ponkickies). He is a green, bucktoothed dinosaur and is usually accompanied by his friend [Muku](http://ilovetheyeti.blogspot.com/2009/06/mukku-yeti.html), a red Yeti. The [Hiragana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana) roughly translates to "Bring it on", or "Come on" as it's written bellow. It seems that the human Gachapin wants to fight someone.&#x20;
