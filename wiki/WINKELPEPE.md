# WINKELPEPE

**Series:** 2, Card 34  
**Supply:** 1/1

## Lore

Created by **DanDarkPill**. Originally minted as 2 assets; one was sent to a burn address five days after issuance, making it a 1-of-1. The image is from *The Shining*—the twin girls in the hallway ("Come and play with us, Danny"). Dan pasted green versions of **Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss** (who claim Mark Zuckerberg stole their Facebook idea at Harvard) onto the twins' heads. The Winklevii went on to found Gemini and became the first Bitcoin billionaires.
