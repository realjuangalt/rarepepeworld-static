## Lore

**Series 22, Card 23** - [PEPENAL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPENAL) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni had this to say about this card, "it is based on my love of [Final Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final\_Fantasy\_\(video\_game\)), this is the four [Warriors of Dawn ](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Warriors\_of\_Dawn)from [FF5](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Final\_Fantasy\_V). I tried to express [Yoshitaka Amano](https://www.yoshitakaamano.com/about)'s touch. I personally like this card very much. I think it was more popular back in 2017 than it is now."
