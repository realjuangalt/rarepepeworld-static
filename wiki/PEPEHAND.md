## Lore

**Series 25, Card 27** - [PEPEHAND](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEHAND) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni said of PEPEHAND, "Something is about to be born beyond the sadness. I also feel anger and resentment. What do you think is born from destroying something? What you see beyond that may change depending on the owner of the card."
