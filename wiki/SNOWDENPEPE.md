## Lore

The person pictured on the card is [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward\_Snowden), the computer intelligence consultant who leaked highly classified information from the [National Security Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National\_Security\_Agency) (NSA)  in 2013. Also pictured is a [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's\_Cube). One interesting fact about this card is it's supply number - 40,320. RPT recently wrote in the official Telegram chat room that he chose that number because the total number of ways the positions of the 8 corner pieces of a Rubik's Cube can be arranged is 40,320.
