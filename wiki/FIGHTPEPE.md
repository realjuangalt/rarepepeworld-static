## Lore

**Series 17 Card 39 -** [**FIGHTPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FIGHTPEPE) was created by the artist known as 0jak. It is a mash-up of the video game "[Street Fighter](https://streetfighter.fandom.com/wiki/Street\_Fighter\_Wiki)" and and the cutest martial arts fight ever captured on film:smile:. The original "fight" video can be viewed below.
