# RAREPEPE

**Series:** 1, Card 1  
**Supply:** 1/300

## Lore

The first Rare Pepe ever attached to the Bitcoin blockchain — the card that started it all. The creator, known only as **Mike**, posted this asset on the Counterparty platform on September 9, 2016. He was also the first Rare Pepe Scientist (cards 1–1,000).

The image is a parody of **Dorian Nakamoto**, who was falsely identified as Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2014 *Newsweek* article. Ownership of the Nakamoto Card grants access to the exclusive **300 Club**.
