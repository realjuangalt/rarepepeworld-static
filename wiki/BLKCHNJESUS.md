John created an astounding 80 Rare Pepe cards, along with being a Rare Pepe Scientist and a member of the CounterParty team. The card is a parody of the statue [Buddy Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy\_Christ) which was featured in the Kevin Smith film [Dogma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogma\_\(film\)).&#x20;
