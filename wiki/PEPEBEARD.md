\
PEPEBEARD is a parody of the purported [flag of Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag\_of\_Blackbeard) which was attributed to Edward Teach (or Thatch), who was better known as [Blackbeard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard) the Pirate. As you can see from the image above, the original flag did not contain the severed head of [Wojak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojak) (or anyone else for that matter).&#x20;
