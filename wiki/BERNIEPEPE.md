## Lore

The man pictured on the card is the American politician and activist [Bernie Sanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie\_Sanders). The text on the card is a parody of a talking point that Sanders used several times while campaigning to become the President of the United States including on [July 1, 2015 in Madison Wisconsin](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2015/jul/29/bernie-s/bernie-sanders-madison-claims-top-01-americans-hav/).&#x20;

RarePepeTrader stated recently in the official Telegram chat room that he issued 1,889 BERNIEPEPE cards because that was the number of delegates he won at the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries, however according to [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016\_Democratic\_Party\_presidential\_primaries), the actual number was 1,865. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2016/mar/25/us-election-2016-delegate-tracker-trump-cruz-kasich-sanders-clinton) puts the number at 1,893 so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
