## Lore

Created by **ICQPEPE**. An ultra-rare 3-issue card—only 3 exist. A tribute to **Yung Lean** (Jonatan Aron Leandoer Håstad), the Swedish rapper who rose to fame in 2013 with "Ginseng Strip 2002" from *Lavender EP*.

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 4](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-4) (pepe.wtf).*
