## Lore

**Series 23, Card 16** - [PEROCHI](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEROCHI) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! The pepe on the card is modeled after the character [Doppo Orochi](https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Doppo\_Orochi) from the Japanese manga series [Grappler Baki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baki\_the\_Grappler). He has a brave "no step down" characteristic about him when it comes to fighting going as far as to fight a Siberian tiger in his younger days and even admits that was a bit foolish of him, but earning him one of his many nicknames the "Tiger Killer". In regard to that Oni said, "It was fun to change the tiger to a stuffed animal."
