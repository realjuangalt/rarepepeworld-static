## Lore

Created by **Theo Goodman** (artist, auctioneer, retired Rare Pepe Scientist), who also made PEPENATION, KEISERPEPE, HYIPPEPE, PONZIPEPE, EGGPLANTPEPE, and others. The card depicts **Vinay Gupta**, co-founder of Ethereum, who has described himself as a "guru." Theo noted that Gupta "says a lot of random shit that 'sounds smart'" and had a notable presence during Ethereum's founding before stepping out of the spotlight.
