## Lore

**Series 6, Card 14 -** [**THEANCAPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THEANCAPEPE) was created by [Raf Vantongerloo](https://x.com/RafVantongerloo). The subject of the card is [Anarcho-capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism) or ANCAP for short. It pictures Pepe the frog in the official colors of the movement - black ([anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism)) and gold ([capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)). The background appears to be a [graffiti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti) painted wall with a "Circle-A" which is universally recognized as a [symbol of anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchist\_symbolism) which most Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves to be. ANCAP's differ from anarchists in that they support private property and private institutions among other things.&#x20;
