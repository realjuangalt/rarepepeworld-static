# HAIRPEPE

**Series:** 1, Card 18  
**Supply:** 1/1,000

## Lore

Created by **ayaLAN**, who sadly lost the keys to the issuing wallet. A cult classic among early Rare Pepe collectors. The image is inspired by Japanese comedian Yuki Himura; the text references Pantene and Maybelline. Ownership grants entry to the private Telegram room **"The Salon"**—a bot scans wallets for the card and grants or revokes access.
