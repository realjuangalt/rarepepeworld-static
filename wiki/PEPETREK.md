## Lore

\
I asked Mekabu if they have Star Trek in Japan. His response was "I first watched Star Trek when I was in high school. It was on late at night and I remember rubbing my sleepy eyes as I watched it. I don't remember the series, but it was "StarTrek: The Next Generation" that was on the air at the time. After that I watched DS9, BEYOND, INTO DARKNESS, Discovery, and PICARD. I have also watched some older series, but not all."
