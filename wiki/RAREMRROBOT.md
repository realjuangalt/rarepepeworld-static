## Lore

Created by an unknown artist (2 cards total). The card shows a pepefied **Rami Malek** from the TV series *Mr. Robot*, in which he plays a computer hacker. The made-up code on the card fits the theme.

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 2](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-2) (pepe.wtf).*
