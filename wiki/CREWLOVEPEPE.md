## Lore

**Series 22, Card 7** - [CREWLOVEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CREWLOVEPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1Lmy7WxetaSMrCodyczDgjb6ELeJu78KiC).  The card is an edited version of the 2011 mixtape by [Young Love](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young\_Money\_Entertainment) titled ["Crew Love Vol 1 Mixtape"](https://mixtapewire.com/2011/08/young-money-crew-love-vol-1-mixtape/). The face used for the man on the far left was also used for the Rare Pepe card [BADASSPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BADASSPEPE) by the same artist.&#x20;
