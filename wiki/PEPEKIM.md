## Lore

The card is a parody of [an image](https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-kim-kardashian-cover-1427450475.html?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1) of [Kim Kardashian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim\_Kardashian) that appeared in the magazine _Paper_ in the winter of 2014. The accompanying article was entitled "Break the Internet" which Zed changed to "Break the Blockchain."
