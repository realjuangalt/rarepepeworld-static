# SHITCOINCARD

**Series:** 1, Card 3  
**Supply:** 1/3,000

## Lore

Created by **Mike**, who started the Rare Pepe project and was the first Rare Pepe Scientist. To Bitcoin maximalists, every other project is a "shitcoin." The card takes a jab at buyers and traders of them, calling out Litecoin, Maza, and NuBits specifically.
