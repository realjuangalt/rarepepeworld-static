## Lore

**Series 21, Card 6** - [PEPETOPKEK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETOPKEK) was created by [Nathan Sonic](https://pepe.wtf/artists/nathan-sonic). He created a total of 14 cards for the Rare Pepe project. In Turkish, kek means cake, and Topkek, a brand of cupcakes, was first produced in 1990 by [ETi](https://www.etiinternational.com/eti-topkek-cake-with-strawberry), a Turkish confectionery company. This card is a green version of the topkek strawberry cupcake packaging. The term Topkek became a [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/topkek.) on [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/) in 2013.
