## Lore

The images were taken from the Japanese animated made-for-TV film [Lupin III (Part 4)](https://theartarchivee.com/2018/07/28/retro-retrospective-lupin-iii-part-4/). These films, staring the [Manga character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupin\_the\_Third) of the same name aired yearly between 1989 and 2013. The sign at the bottom left appears to be taken from the [2014 Mt. Gox protestors](https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/19/5425220/protest-at-mt-gox-bitcoin-exchange-in-tokyo).
