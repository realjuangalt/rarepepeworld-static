## Lore

Created by **NeedMoney90**, the sole owner of all 50 Series 1 cards. The image was taken from the cover of *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams. Everything on the card references the book: "Don't Panic," the number 42 ("the answer to life, the universe, and everything"), the towel, the whale, the bowl of petunias, and Beeblebrox.

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 1](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-1) (pepe.wtf).*
