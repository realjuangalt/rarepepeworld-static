## Lore

**Series 5, Card 29 -** [LITTLEBOPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LITTLEBOPEPE) was created by the artist known as [OE](https://pepe.wtf/artists/OE) ([@EverydayEarth](https://twitter.com/EverydayEarth) on Twitter). The GIF on the card was taken from two different sources. The first was taken from Season 1 Episode 6 of the British Television sitcom Entitled [Black Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_Books) that aired from 2000 to 2004. The episode is entitled "He's Leaving Home" and at the 18:45 mark, the character Manny who was played by English actor, comedian, and musician [Bill Bailey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill\_Bailey) was dressed as [Little Bo-Peep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little\_Bo-Peep) for a photoshoot. You can view the whole episode [here](https://youtu.be/0WJL5UOF5pE?t=1125). The second part of the GIF was of a viral video from 2012 of a [sheep pushing a fisherman into a lake](https://youtu.be/NAlfCowo0uI). &#x20;
