If you've ever played a version of Mortal Kombat you will get the included text "Get Over Here!" - A classic line that Scorpion says to his opponent while throwing his spear on the end of a chain at them. And the bit about "Babality" is hilarious because that is the name of one of the [hidden fatalities](https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Babality) in the game. Instead of finishing your opponent by tearing their head off, you instead would turn them into a cute little baby.&#x20;
