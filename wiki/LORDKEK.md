# LORDKEK

**Series:** 1, Card 34  
**Supply:** 1/10 (divisible — “dust” trades)

## Lore

**LORDKEK** has legendary status in the Rare Pepe community. When minting the card, **@Robness** mistakenly made it infinitely divisible, so the card “broke” not long after mint. Particles (“dust”) of the card trade to this day. Apart from a handful of addresses holding one full card, it is practically impossible to collect a full LORDKEK.

The artwork was made by **@NeedMoney90**; @Robness minted the asset. The card is often said to possess mystical properties.
