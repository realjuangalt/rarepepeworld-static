# HERNIAPEPE

**Series:** 1, Card 45  
**Supply:** 1/115

## Lore

The subject is **Mike Hearn**, a longtime Bitcoin Core developer. During the Blocksize Wars he advocated for larger blocks and created Bitcoin XT. After his proposal failed, Hearn declared Bitcoin a failed project in January 2016, sold his bitcoin, and left the community—a move many called a "whiny ragequit." The black-and-white sketch used for the card came from a 2014 Cointelegraph article about Hearn.
