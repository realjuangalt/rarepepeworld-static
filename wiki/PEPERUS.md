**Series 8, Card 32** - [PEPERUS](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPERUS) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/15qdhYM8WXZQUCPsR1oeoWkfCmBgeUZXht). They crated a total of 8 cards for the Rare Pepe project. The card depicts a shirtless Pepe with a gold "P" pendant dangling from a gold chain around his neck riding a bear through a river or stream. The source photo (shown above) is of Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir\_Putin) riding a horse. The text on the card is Bulgarian and roughly translates to "pepper".&#x20;
