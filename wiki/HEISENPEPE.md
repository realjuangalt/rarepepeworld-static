## Lore

Created by **Django Bits**, who made 13 Rare Pepe cards. The card pays homage to *Breaking Bad*: the RV Walter White used for cooking meth, the Mexican cartel's sketch of "Heisenberg," a parody of "I am the one who knocks," and the periodic table with element Pepegen (Pe).

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 2](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-2) (pepe.wtf).*
