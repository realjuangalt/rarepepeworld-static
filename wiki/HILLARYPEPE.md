## Lore

In September 2016, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election and less than a month after the Rare Pepe project and directory launched, Pepe the frog was branded a hate symbol of the alt-right by Democratic candidate **Hillary Clinton**. The project came under scrutiny. HILLARYPEPE was created and added to the directory to respond to that moment.
