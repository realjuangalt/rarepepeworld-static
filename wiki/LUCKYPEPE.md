## Lore

Created by **DanDarkPill**, who made 26 cards for the project. The subject is the **maneki-neko** ("beckoning cat"), a Japanese figurine believed to bring good luck to shop owners. Records date to 1852 in Edo. Often mistaken as Chinese in origin due to its popularity in Chinatowns worldwide.
