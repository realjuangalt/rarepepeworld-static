## Lore

**Series 9, Card 6 -** [**RUBBERPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RUBBERPEPE) was created by [Raf Vantongerloo](https://x.com/RafVantongerloo). Also created by Raf are  [THEANCAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THEANCAPEPE), [STEALPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/STEALPEPE), [PPKING](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PPKING), [PREPEDATOR](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PREPEDATOR), and [SCORPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SCORPEPE). The card appears to be a hand drawn interpretation of the character Johnny played by [Chris Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris\_Cunningham) in the 2005 British experimental short film/music video [Rubber Johnny](https://youtu.be/eRvfxWRi6qQ) which was written, directed, and produced by Cunningham as well. In the opening scene, an off screen voice can be heard saying "do you want mama to come in?" which causes Johnny to throw a fit for which he is given a sedative to calm down. The rest of the video is just Johnny maneuvering his wheel chair while the [Aphex Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex\_Twin) track "Afx237 v. 7" from the album [_Drukqs_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drukqs) plays in the background. That is the band's logo in the top right corner of the card. Also included on the card is a hand drawn Chihuahua Dog to match the real Chihuahua in the  film.&#x20;
