## Lore

**Series 36, Card 7** -[ MOONPEPESUN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MOONPEPESUN) was created by an unknown artist, and this is the only card they created for the Rare Pepe project. The source image used for this card is called Sol y Luna. I could not find the artist who created it, but a great many [sun and moon paintings](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/430516045609652833/) can be found online. The artist used what appears to be a closeup black and white photograph of a human brain for the bottom half of the card. &#x20;
