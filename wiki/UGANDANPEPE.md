## Lore

**Series 31, Card 17** - [UGANDANPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/UGANDANPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1NVvsfD2rgv2J2JewXZ9KgLvkYBW4FYyxW). They created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project.  The card is a parody of [Ugandan Knuckles](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ugandan-knuckles), who is in turn a parody of the character [Knuckles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckles\_the\_Echidna) from the [Sonic the Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic\_the\_Hedgehog) franchise. Ugandan Knuckles was created by YouTuber [Gregzilla](https://www.youtube.com/user/GregzillaGT) in 2017.&#x20;
