## Lore

**Series 30, Card 1** - [PEPEZAALBINO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEZAALBINO) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni said of PEPEZAALBINO, "I made this one because I love [Dragon Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon\_Ball\_Z) so much. And at the time, I wanted to make a card without color, so I did." The pepe on the card is called [Frieza](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Frieza) and he is sat in his hoverchair.
