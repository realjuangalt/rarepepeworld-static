## Lore

**Series 27, Card 7** - [CLAYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CLAYPEPE) was created by a Japanese artist known as [Mekabu](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mekabu). He created a total of four cards for the Rare Pepe project. The other three being [TADPOLEPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/TADPOLEPEPE), [PEPETREK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPETREK), and [HAPPYRAINY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HAPPYRAINY). Here is what he had to say about this card, "Yes, all of my CLAY series are made of clay, not 3DCG. I use rice flour clay. It is very smooth and does not have crystals floating on the surface after drying like wheat clay and stays beautiful. Only the top left photo is wheat clay. It was made by children and is the source of the idea for CLAYPEPE." Below is an image Mekabu gave me that show the inspiration for the card and some in-progress shots.
