## Lore

**Series 29, Card 45** - [PEPEDARKSIDE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEDARKSIDE) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni said of PEPEDARKSIDE, "This may be my original touch for drawing. I drew this because I wanted to draw it the way I like it. I don't have anything original in mind. I drew the dark side that PEPE has. I wonder if he will remain in the darkness?"
