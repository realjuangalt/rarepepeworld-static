## Lore

Created by **Héctor Cárdenas** (Hcarpach), who also created HARDPEPEFORK, DAOPEPEHACK, and RARECHAVEZ. The image and text reflect the fact that in 2016 most of the Bitcoin network's hashrate was in China—with Pepe substituted for Bitcoin for comedic effect. China later banned Bitcoin mining in 2021, though it remains among the top mining countries.
