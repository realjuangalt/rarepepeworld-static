## Lore

**Series 21, Card 18** - [PEPEBALL](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEBALL) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! Oni said of PEPEBALL, "I made this one because I love [Dragon Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z) so much." The pepe in the [gi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karate_gi) was modeled after the main protagonist of the series - [Goku](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Goku).&#x20;
