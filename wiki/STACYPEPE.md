## Lore

The card image is a parody of an image Morris found of Stacy Herbert, co-host of the television show [_The Keiser Report_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiser\_Report) where she was dressed as the [Tin Woodman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin\_Woodman) from the book and film [_The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Wonderful\_Wizard\_of\_Oz) for Halloween. He replaced the Silver element symbol (Ag) sign on her chest (did she not know that it should have been Sn for Tin?) for a PEPECASH Card and added a stock chart in the background which is representative of the show.&#x20;
