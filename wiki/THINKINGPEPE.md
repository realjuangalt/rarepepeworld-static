## Lore

**Series 16, Card 29** - [THINKINGPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/THINKINGPEPE) was created by the artist known as [Pepe\_1337](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Pepe\_1337) who created a total of 21 Rare Pepe cards. It is an original piece based on the famous bronze sculpture by [Auguste Rodin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste\_Rodin) called ["The Thinker"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Thinker)  (_Le Penseur in French_). On May 19, 2024 Pepe\_1337 posted the following in the Official Rare Pepe Telegram chat room, "for those who were wondering, THINKINGPEPE started off as a sketch, then acrylic painting, then transferred and digitally enhanced." And he shared the image below of the original acrylic painting.
