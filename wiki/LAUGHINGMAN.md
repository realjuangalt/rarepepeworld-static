## Lore

**Series 32, Card 19** - [LAUGHINGMAN](https://pepe.wtf/asset/LAUGHINGMAN) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1CQ8iuxrkf4DWsFttDtwyRbrJT8U4R212E). They created a total of 13 cards for the Rare Pepe project.  The source for this card is the logo for hacker and cyberterrorist "[The Laughing Man](https://ghostintheshell.fandom.com/wiki/Laughing\_Man)" from the Japanese anime television series _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_. In the show, the character is only ever shown with his logo covering his face. The text on the logo is an excerpt from the book "[The Catcher in the Rye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Catcher\_in\_the\_Rye)" by [J. D. Salinger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.\_D.\_Salinger). [Here](https://www.otakunews.com/Article/201/the-laughing-man-ghost-in-the-shell-standalone-complexs-hacker-logo) is an interview with the man that created the logo, Paul Nicholson.&#x20;
