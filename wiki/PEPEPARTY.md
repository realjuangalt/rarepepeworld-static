## Lore

Created by **Joe Looney** (see STILLPEPE). The card depicts three Counterparty developers—Evan Wagner (top left), Robby Dermody (top right), and Adam Krellenstein (bottom)—with the tongue-in-cheek line "Spamming the block chain since January 2014." In reality, Counterparty gave Bitcoin one of its first true use cases.
