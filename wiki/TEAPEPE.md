## Lore

The card is a modified version of the [original color woodcut](https://chazen.wisc.edu/collection/6014/swallows-peach-blossoms-and-full-moon/) entitled _"Swallows, Peach Blossoms and Full Moon"_ by the Japanese [ukiyo-e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukiyo-e) artist [Utagawa Hiroshige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshige) in 1935. The TEAPEPE artist removed the bottom two peach blossom branches and swallows, added a steaming cup of green pepe tea and added a kneeling woman with a pepe head holding a cup of tea.
