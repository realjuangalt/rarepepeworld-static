## Lore

This card is a parody of the [Sistine Chapel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine\_Chapel) and focuses on [Michelangelo's frescoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine\_Chapel#Michelangelo's\_frescoes). The level of detail that was put into this card is impressive - they replaced every single viewable painting in the scene with images of frogs and [Wojaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wojak).&#x20;
