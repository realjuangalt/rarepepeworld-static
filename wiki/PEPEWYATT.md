## Lore

The card is the artist's rendition of a [2020 Tee Shirt advertisement](https://twitter.com/WWEShop/status/1271102769756344322?s=20\&t=Xt6mmcf-CPH6gcBePYpFNQ) that appeared on Twitter. The man pictured is [Bray Wyatt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bray\_Wyatt), an American pro wrestler that is better known as The Fiend. Wyatt's catchphrase was "Follow the Buzzards," which was changed to "Follow the Blockchain" by Easy B. for his card.&#x20;
