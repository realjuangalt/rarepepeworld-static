## Lore

Created by an unknown artist (who also made BANEPEPE). The card pairs the character **PC Principal** from *South Park* (Season 19, Episode 1 — "Stunning and Brave") with a person from a 2016 Donald Trump rally in St. Louis, Missouri. The text "Are You Kidding Me" is a quote from the man the internet dubbed "Carl the Cuck."
