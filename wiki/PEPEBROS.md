## Lore

Created by an unknown artist who also made MAGICPEPEYE. The card pays homage to *Super Mario Bros.* (1985, NES). The artist either created an original scene or upscaled a scene to 1:1 pixels and added a sun with a Wojak face.

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 1](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-1) (pepe.wtf).*
