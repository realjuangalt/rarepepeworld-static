## Lore

**Series 23, Card 48** - [PEPEEVO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEEVO) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project and all 9 are original artworks! Oni said of PEPEEVO, "I drew PEPE changing his appearance. His appearance changes depending on the environment around him. His appearance may also change depending on the owner of this card. I wonder how he will evolve?"
