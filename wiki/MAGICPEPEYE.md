## Lore

Created by the same unknown artist who made PEPEBROS (their only two contributions). The card pays homage to **Magic Eye**, the early-1990s fad of autostereogram images—two-dimensional pictures that create the illusion of a 3D scene when viewed correctly.

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 1](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-1) (pepe.wtf).*
