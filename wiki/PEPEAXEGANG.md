## Lore

Based on the axe logo at the top of this otherwise hand-drawn card my best guess is that the artist was making reference to the Chinese [gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Axe\_Gang) founded in 1921 of the same name that was popularized by the 2004 action-comedy film [_**Kung Fu Hustle**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung\_Fu\_Hustle).&#x20;
