He created a total of three cards for the Rare Pepe series. The other two being [EXCLUPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/EXCLUPEPE) and [MONOPEPEOLY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MONOPEPEOLY). PEPELEMMING is based on the 1991 video game [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings\_\(video\_game\)) which was developed for the [Amiga personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga). Within a year of release the game was ported to other computers including the [Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari\_ST), [Sinclair Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX\_Spectrum), the PC, and [Super Nintendo Entertainment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super\_Nintendo\_Entertainment\_System).
