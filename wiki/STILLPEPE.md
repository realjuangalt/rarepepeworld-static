## Lore

Created by **Joe Looney**, who also wrote [Rare Pepe Wallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/) and created 13 cards including PEPEPARTY, IMWITHPEPE, PEPEGOTCHI, and BADHAIRDAY. The card shows "Pepefied" versions of **Snoop Dogg** and **Dr. Dre**—a still from the music video. INVISIBLPEPE (Series 30) later had STILLPEPE's private key secretly embedded in its image metadata.
