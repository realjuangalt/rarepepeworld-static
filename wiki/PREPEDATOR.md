## Lore

**Series 9, Card 13 -** [**PREPEDATOR**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PREPEDATOR) was created by [Raf Vantongerloo](https://x.com/RafVantongerloo). The image is a reverse-colored version of a promotional image used for the 2004 American science fiction action horror film [Alien vs. Predator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien\_vs.\_Predator\_\(film\)).  That is where the similarities end however. The card's text refers to [Chris Hansen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris\_Hansen) the host of an American [reality television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality\_television) series in the television [news magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News\_magazine) program [Dateline NBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dateline\_NBC) titled [To Catch a Predato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To\_Catch\_a\_Predator)r.  In the show, Hansen was allowed to film inside [sting houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sting\_operation) across the United States and interview adult men after they were arrested for attempting to have sex with a minor. Almost every interview began with Hansen telling the person, "[take a seat](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Take%20a%20seat)."
