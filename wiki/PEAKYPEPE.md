**Series:** 25

## Lore

The card was modeled after a still image from the English crime drama television series [Peaky Blinders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaky\_Blinders\_\(TV\_series\)#Cast\_and\_characters)' main character [Tommy Shelby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy\_Shelby), played by [Cillian Murphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cillian\_Murphy).

RPT stated recently in the official Rare Pepe Telegram chat room that he made the issuance of the card 1,921 because that was the year portrayed in the first season of the show. However [this article](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/when-is-peaky-blinders-set) states that Series 1 took place in 1919 and Series 2 took place in 1921 so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯.
