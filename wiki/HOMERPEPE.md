# HOMERPEPE

**Series:** 2, Card 32  
**Supply:** 1/1

## Lore

Created by **Boost**. A parody of **Homer Simpson** from *The Simpsons*, including an intentional typo ("mintue"). The **rarest card** (1-of-1) and one of the most famous. At the first digital art auction in history—2018 Rare Digital Art Festival in NYC—it sold for **350,000 PEPECASH** (~$39,000) to Peter Kell ("PEPECASH Millionaire"). Kell and the card appeared in the *Feels Good Man* documentary; in March 2021 it resold for **$312,000**, demonstrating that tokenized art could hold major value.
