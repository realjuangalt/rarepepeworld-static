## Lore

**Series 18, Card 10** - [PEPEKYRIE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEKYRIE) was created by [Ariya Minase](https://twitter.com/aria\_minase). She created a total of four cards for the Rare Pepe series including the Pokémon parody [BULBAPEPECRD](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BULBAPEPECRD). The card is an adaptation of the 1989 Japanese arcade game [Valkyrie no Densetsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valkyrie\_no\_Densetsu). The game describes Valkyrie's companion Kurino Xandra as "lizard-like" but we all know it's really a frog . &#x20;
