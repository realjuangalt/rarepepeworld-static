## Lore

Created by **Robness**, who also collaborated on LORDKEK and is credited with five cards. The image is from the CowParade—an international public art exhibit of decorated fiberglass cows. The card depicts "Taxi Cow" from New York City, created by Swiss sculptor Pascal Knapp. Robness's Poloniex username was GROUNDBEEFTAXI; the card text references being "banned by the banhammer" in the exchange's Troll Box.
