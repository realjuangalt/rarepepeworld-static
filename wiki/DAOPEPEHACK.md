## Lore

Created by **Héctor Cárdenas** (Hcarpach). The card depicts **Stephan Tual**, CCO of the Ethereum Foundation at the time of the **DAO hack**—the first major hack on a major blockchain. The aftermath split the community into those who supported a chain rollback and those who did not, leading to Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). Famous Rare Pepes list it as "the Ethereum DAO hack" card.
