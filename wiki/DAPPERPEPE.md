## Lore

The man on the card is American film actor, [Clark Gable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark\_Gable) on the set of the 1936 film "[Wife vs. Secretary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife\_vs.\_Secretary)". It appears Mr. Gable is doing some leisure reading between takes, or reading his script while enjoying a cold beverage.&#x20;
