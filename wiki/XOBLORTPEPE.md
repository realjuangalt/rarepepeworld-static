## Lore

Created by the artist known as Horus. The card is a tribute to a user with the handle **XOBLORT**, an admin of the live chat "Troll Box" on the crypto exchange Poloniex. As an admin, XOBLORT could ban users. The Poloniex Troll Box was disabled in 2017 so moderators could focus on customer support.
