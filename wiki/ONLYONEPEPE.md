# ONLYONEPEPE

**Series:** 1, Card 32  
**Supply:** 1/1

## Lore

Created by **DanDarkPill**. The **first 1-of-1 card** in the Rare Pepe project—meaning only one person could ever own it. That made it theoretically possible for a single collector to own all 50 cards of Series 1. NeedMoney90 (NM) announced on Bitcointalk in April 2017 that he had purchased ONLYONEPEPE, JONGPEPE, and LORDKEK for 11 BTC ($12,001 USD at the time).
