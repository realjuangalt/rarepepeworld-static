## Lore

**Series 13, Card 42** - [BEWPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BEWPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1JMa2DJwFjW5EYdqaXPKwGpqEjQ15dq3Xy). They also created the cards [GOKUPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GOKUPEPE) and [PEPECCOLO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECCOLO) for the Rare Pepe project. This hand-drawn card is a parody of the Japanese trading card game [Yu-Gi-Oh! ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu-Gi-Oh!)card, [Blue-Eyes White Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blue-Eyes\_White\_Dragon).
