## Lore

Created October 13, 2016 by **RareScrilla**. The **first audio NFT**—tokenized crypto art linked to music. Issued in 169 copies; owners could access bonus content via a private SoundCloud link. Part of a four-card "Hip-Hop" series with MCPEPE, BBOYPEPE, and PEPEONE. Cards were mostly given away at blockchain conferences 2017–19, making them highly sought-after and an early example of unlockable bonus content.
