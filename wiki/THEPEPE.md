## Lore

The image on the card is a parody of the American film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer production logo that ran before all their movies and television cartoons. The lion in the film is named [Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo\_the\_Lion\_\(MGM\)). Between 1917 and 1924, there were eleven different lions used for the logo. In 2021, MGM introduced a new CGI Logo which features a lion partially based on Leo.
