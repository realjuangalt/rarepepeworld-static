## Lore

**Series 5, Card 2** - [**SPESSMUHPEPE**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/SPESSMUHPEPE) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1HDXVbA9WS5WwuhxqmWjwAY8eAgehGo5TH). They also created the other two Warhammer 40,000 cards that made it into the Rare Pepe project - [GODEMPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GODEMPEPE) and [GUARDSPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/GUARDSPEPE). The image on the card is a modified version of the character [Space Marine](https://warhammer40k.fandom.com/wiki/Space\_Marines) from the board game [Warhammer 40,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer\_40,000).&#x20;
