## Lore

**Series 21, Card 42** - [PEPEJIRO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEJIRO) was created by the Japanese artist known as [Oni Giri](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Oni-Giri). She created a total of 9 cards for the Rare Pepe project; 8 of which are original artworks! The pepe on the card is modeled after the character [Yuujirou Hanma](https://baki.fandom.com/wiki/Yuujirou_Hanma) from the Japanese manga series [Grappler Baki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baki_the_Grappler). Oni said of PEPEJIRO, "I don't think Yuujiro is that popular, but I have the impression that people who like him like this card." When Yuujirou flexes his latissimus dorsi muscles, his back takes the shape of a demon's face, thus increasing his strength and combat abilities. In regard to that Oni said "It was fun to change the face of the original demon." On the card it reads "It looks like a frog's face!"
