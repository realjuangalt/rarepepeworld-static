## Lore

Created by an unknown artist; their only submission to the Rare Pepe project. According to the user Trout on Telegram, the card was named after him because he was a well-known altcoin trader on Twitter at the time. The symbols under the trout's fin represent some of the altcoin bags Trout was holding. "Shitcoin" refers to altcoins with little value or purpose.
