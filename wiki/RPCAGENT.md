## Lore

**Series 8, Card 5** - [RPCAGENT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RPCAGENT) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1H8BCtycCtEsxzTmXj9qFEZAWbtaqaRPGE) and this was their only card contributed to the Rare Pepe series. The original image was taken from Season 8, Episode 10 of the American animated sitcom called [The Simpsons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Simpsons) which was entitled ["The Springfield Files"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Springfield\_Files). The episode was a parody of another show called [The X-Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_X-Files) which stared [David Duchovny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David\_Duchovny) and [Gillian Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian\_Anderson). Both actors were "Simpsonized" for the episode and did their own voiceovers. It originally aired on January 12, 1997.
