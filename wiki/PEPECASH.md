# PEPECASH

**Series:** 1, Card 11  
**Supply:** Divisible (less than 700 million in circulation)

## Lore

Alongside XCP, **PEPECASH** was the built-in currency of Rare Pepe Wallet. Created by **Mike**, it is a card like the others but much more liquid. It was used to pay submission fees to get Rare Pepes into the Rare Pepe Directory. Each week, half of submission earnings were sacrificed to Kek for good luck, making PEPECASH deflationary.

In late 2017, PEPECASH received the same categorization as Bitcoin as a “first class” cryptocurrency in Japan, one of only 17 digital tokens that could be legally traded at the time.
