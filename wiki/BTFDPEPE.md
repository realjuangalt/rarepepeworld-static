## Lore

The original image was taken from a [Coindesk article](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2014/07/02/vc-tim-draper-revealed-as-silk-road-bitcoin-auction-winner/) from 2014 that announced that the venture capitalist [Tim Draper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim\_Draper) was the winning bidder of all 29,656 bitcoins that were auctioned off by the US Marshals.  The bitcoins were those that were seized by the US government when they shut down the online marketplace called [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk\_Road\_\(marketplace\)). I could not get my phone to read it, but Bench let me know that it leads to the transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain where the Bitcoins purchased by Draper were transferred into his wallet.   &#x20;
