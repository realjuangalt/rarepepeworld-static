# PEPEROSS

**Series:** 2, Card 11  
**Supply:** 1/50

## Lore

Created by **Boost**. The **first Rare Pepe to directly reference a previous directory card**—replacing the landscape in Bob Ross's *The Grandeur of Summer* (One Hour Special) with the RAREPEPE (Nakamoto) card. Pays tribute to **Bob Ross**, creator and host of *The Joy of Painting* (1983–1994).

*Adapted from [Book of Kek](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/famous-rare-pepe-cards) and [Series 2](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-2) (pepe.wtf).*
