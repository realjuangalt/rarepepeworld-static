## Lore

**Series 26, Card 29** - [CREMAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/CREMAPEPE) was created by an unknown artist. This was their sole contribution to the Rare Pepe series. The GIF was taken from from the 1973 Mexican surreal-fantasy film entitled [_"The Holy Mountain"_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Holy\_Mountain\_\(1973\_film\)). The section of the trailer is queued up below.&#x20;
