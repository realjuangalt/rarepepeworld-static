## Lore

Created by an unknown artist; their only submission. The image is **Liam Neeson** from *Taken*, in which he plays ex-CIA officer Bryan Mills hunting his daughter's kidnappers. The card references his line "I will find you, and I will kill you" and a kidnapper's "Good Luck."

*Adapted from [Book of Kek — Series 2](https://wiki.pepe.wtf/chapter-2-the-rare-pepe-project/the-rare-pepe-blockchain-project/series-and-card-specific-lore/series-2) (pepe.wtf).*
