# JONGPEPE

**Series:** 1, Card 41  
**Supply:** 3/3

## Lore

Created by **ICQPEPE**. The image is a pepefied **Kim Jong Il**, then supreme leader of North Korea, from a 2011 moment during talks with Russia's Dmitry Medvedev. Only 3 JONGPEPE exist. When minting, ICQ wrote "Strong Pepe Leader" as the description. Rare Pepe Wallet creator Joe Looney later bought all three for 0.99 XCP on the DEX.
