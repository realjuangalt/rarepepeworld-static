## Lore

**Series 12, Card 24** - [BATBUTBOO](https://pepe.wtf/asset/BATBUTBOO) was created by an [unknown artist](https://pepe.wtf/artists/1Gpe8KHgZpgzpVLwri1UnU99wwCUWmm3cs). The artist had a total of 9 cards accepted into the Rare Pepe project including [PEPONG](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPONG) and [PEPECOLLECT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECOLLECT). The image on the card is an actual "battle station" photo that was posted on the site [4chan](https://www.4chan.org/) in 2013 with the addition of Pepe eating a spoonful of butter. It is unclear whether or not the comments by the poster were a troll or his honest take on enjoying eating butter. The original image and text are below.&#x20;
