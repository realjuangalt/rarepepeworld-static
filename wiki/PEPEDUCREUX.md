## Lore

**Series 5, Card 6** - [**PEPEDUCREUX**](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEDUCREUX) was created by the artist known as [OE](https://pepe.wtf/artists/OE) ([@EverydayEarth](https://twitter.com/EverydayEarth) on Twitter). OE created a total of 18 cards for the Rare Pepe directory including classics such as [MONALISAPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/MONALISAPEPE), [FRYPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/FRYPEPE), [PEPECENT](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECENT), and [PEPEVANEYCK](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPEVANEYCK). The card is a parody of a 1793 painting entitled "_Portrait de l'artiste sous les traits d'un moqueur"_ by [Joseph Ducreux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph\_Ducreux). The painting is one of several self-portraits of the artist.  The text displayed in the PEPEDUCREUX GIF is a parody of the lyrics of the song [Boyz-n-the-Hood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boyz-n-the-Hood) by [Eazy-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eazy-E). OE translated the [original lyrics](https://genius.com/Eazy-e-boyz-n-the-hood-lyrics) "Crusin' down the street in my 6-4. Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough" into "Traversing down the boulevard in my 1764. Sequestering damsels, reprimanding Apostates."&#x20;
