## Lore

Created by Rare Pepe Scientist **Theo Goodman**, who had 22 cards accepted into the directory. With the tagline "better than gold, safer money," the card depicts various internet scams—including OneCoin on the monitor and a slot machine—telling the story of a crying Pepe scammed out of his money. Theo later created a literal PONZIPEPE rug (physical) with a sub-asset PONZIPEPE.RUG for provenance; the first sold at 2023 Pepe Fest in Paris for 500k sats.
