## Lore

**Series 25, Card 22** - [XCHAINPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/XCHAINPEPE) was created by the artist known as [Rare Scrilla](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Rare-Scrilla). This was one of the many hand drawn an colored Rare Pepe cards created by Scrilla. Some others are [PWAPWAPWAPWA](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PWAPWAPWAPWA), [RUNDMP](https://pepe.wtf/asset/RUNDMP), and [DDDPEPE](https://pepe.wtf/asset/DDDPEPE). You can see the original drawing below. The difference being that the card had actual Xchain screens and a chart superimposed over the hand drawn ones. The original was recently sent from Scrilla to [Counterparty ](https://counterparty.io/)developer and [Freewallet](https://freewallet.io/) creator [J-Dog](https://twitter.com/jdogresorg).
