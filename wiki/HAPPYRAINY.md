## Lore

Series 26, Card 45 - [HAPPYRAINY](https://pepe.wtf/asset/HAPPYRAINY) is an original drawing by the Japanese artist known as [Mekabu](https://pepe.wtf/artists/Mekabu). I asked him about it recently and this was his response, "In Japan, the rainy season is called "TSUYU", which is between spring and summer, from the end of May to mid-July. Frogs, hydrangeas, and snails are the standard illustrations for "TSUYU". HAPPYRAINY is just like that. The main subject of this illustration is rain, so I have added a blank space at the top to show the presence of clouds and rain. Please also pay attention to his gaze."
